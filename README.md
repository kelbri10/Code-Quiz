Once the user clicks the start button, the timer starts in the top left hand corner. As the user clicks the correct answer, a message will appear at the bottom stating that the answer is correct.

Once the timer hits 0, the end page is displayed and if the users score beats the highest score they are asked to enter their initials which is then stored in the local storage.
